# 🎉 Leap Year Program 🎉

## Overview
The Leap Year program is a simple Python application that determines whether a given year is a leap year based on established rules.

## What is a Leap Year? 🌍
A leap year is a year that has one extra day added to it, making it 366 days long instead of the usual 365 days. This extra day is added to February, which has 29 days in a leap year instead of 28. Leap years are necessary to keep our calendar in alignment with the Earth's revolutions around the Sun.[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX96xng7sAE) does it more justice.

## How It Works 🔍
A year is considered a leap year if:
- It is divisible by 4.
- It is **not** divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

This program implements these rules to return `True` for leap years and `False` otherwise.

## Features 🌟
- Accepts a year as input.
- Returns whether the year is a leap year or not.
- Example outputs are included for demonstration.
